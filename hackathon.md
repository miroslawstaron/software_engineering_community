# Software Center CI/CD & CD and testing hackathon

This year, we organize a virtual Hackathon for all software center companies and universities. The goal is to work together and learn from each other, at the same time setting up toolchains that can be used in research projects outside of companies' premises. 

## Task for the Hackathon

## Organization
The Hackathon is organized virtually, which means that we do not have one central meeting spot. However, each team can choose to meet and work together. We will provide an open MS Teams channel for each of the team where we could discuss the progress and answer questions. 

The Hackathon is organized in two half-days, where the channel is open and where the organizers are available for questions, comments and discussions. After these hours the teams are welcome to continue discussions, work and collaboration, but this is not a requirement. 

Schedule: 
Day 1: 
8.30 - 9.00: Introduction of the topics and the teams
9.00 - 11.15: Teams working on the topics
11.15 - 12.00: Each team presents 1-2 slides about their current state of the solution, technology used, etc. 

Day 2:
8.30 - 9.00: Check-in and welcome
9.00 - 10.30: Teamwork
10.30 - 11.30: Teams final presentation
11.30 - 12.00: Closing
