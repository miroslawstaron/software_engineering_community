# Software Center CI/CD & CD and testing hackathon

This year, we organize a virtual Hackathon for all software center companies and universities. The goal is to work together and learn from each other, at the same time setting up toolchains that can be used in research projects outside of companies' premises. 

## Dates
Day 1: 2020-11-26: 8.30 - 12.00 <br/>
Day 2: 2020-11-27: 8.30 - 12.00

## Task for the Hackathon
<ol>
  <li>Set-up a generic pipeline for CI and containerize it, to work with flaky tests and other CI tools</li>
  <li>Choose an open source product or create your own product that you can build and test using this pipeline</li>
  <li>Develop a set of tests for the product</li>
  <li>Provide/develop a visual overview of the CI pipeline, in order to produce meaning information vs. producing logs</li>
  <li>Optional: develop a script/tool that can predict if a given test cases will pass/fail during the next build</li>
  <li>Optional: develop a script/tool to identify flaky tests, e.g. using machine learning</li>
</ol>

## Organization
The Hackathon is organized virtually, which means that we do not have one central meeting spot. However, each team can choose to meet and work together. We will provide an open MS Teams channel for each of the team where we could discuss the progress and answer questions. 

The Hackathon is organized in two half-days, where the channel is open and where the organizers are available for questions, comments and discussions. After these hours the teams are welcome to continue discussions, work and collaboration, but this is not a requirement.
