# Software Center CI/CD & CD and testing hackathon

This year, we organize a virtual Hackathon for all software center companies and universities. The goal is to work together and learn from each other, at the same time setting up toolchains that can be used in research projects outside of companies' premises. 

In this Hackathon, the focus is on the container technology, measurement and visualization. 

## Dates
Day 1: 2020-11-26: 8.30 - 12.00 <br/>
Day 2: 2020-11-27: 8.30 - 12.00

## Before the hackathon
<ol>
  <li>Download Docker Desktop and one of the CI tools, e.g. Jenkins (https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins) </li>
  <li>Choose a product or create your own product that you can build and test using this pipeline.</li>
  <li>You can also choose an OSS project which you like, we suggest some of the following (not a requirement):
    <ul>
      <li>Visual Studio Code editor: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute#build-and-run</li>
      <li>JUnit: https://github.com/junit-team/junit5<li/>
      <li>Notepad++: https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/BUILD.md</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

## Task for the Hackathon
<ol>  
  <li>Develop a set of tests for the product.</li>
  <li>Provide/develop a visual overview of the CI pipeline, in order to produce meaning information vs. producing logs.</li>
  <li>Optional: develop a script/tool that can predict if a given test cases will pass/fail during the next build.</li>
</ol>

## Expected outcomes
Every team is expected to demonstrate their solution to all participants. 

## Organization
The Hackathon is organized virtually, which means that we do not have one central meeting spot. However, each team can choose to meet and work together. We will provide an open MS Teams channel for each of the team where we could discuss the progress and answer questions. 

The Hackathon is organized in two half-days, where the channel is open and where the organizers are available for questions, comments and discussions. After these hours the teams are welcome to continue discussions, work and collaboration, but this is not a requirement. 

Schedule: <br/>
Day 1: <br/>
8.30 - 9.00: Introduction of the topics and the teams <br/>
9.00 - 11.15: Teams working on the topics <br/>
11.15 - 12.00: Each team presents 1-2 slides about their current state of the solution, technology used, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Day 2: <br/>
8.30 - 9.00: Check-in and welcome <br/>
9.00 - 10.30: Teamwork <br/>

## Technology
All teams are allowed to use the technology of their choosing, with the following conditions:
* the delivery of the solution should be done as a Docker container,
* the delivery should contain example data, which can be used when replicating this work, and
* the delivery shoult NOT contain any company specific data or technology, 

## How to apply
Applications are welcome from all Software Center companies and universities. 
* if you already have a team, please apply here: https://choodle.portal.chalmers.se/OUoM67QRj2WjTfUL
