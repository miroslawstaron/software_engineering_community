# Continuous Integration (CI) workshop
The goal of this workshop is to discuss current activities in CI, testing and code analysis. The expected outcome is to share experiences, find common activities and explore ideas for the next sprint. 

We want to find out what challenges companies have in this area and how we can assist in solving these challenges. 

# Date and time
**Date**: 25/9
**Time**: 10.00 - 12.00
**Place**: MS Teams, link will be distributed to the registered participants. 

Registration is free and open for all software center companies. We distribute MS Outlook (iCal) invitations and will send the link using that channel. 

# Content - what we want to talk about
* CI testing and ML
* Finding flaky tests using ML
* Using ML to prioritize CI flow activities (e.g. which static analysis checks to use)
